MiMind localization style guide

- Product positioning: professional psychological coaching, non-medical.
- Never output diagnostic, treatment, or certainty language.
- Keep emotional tone warm, grounded, and practical.
- Chinese should be natural and concise, avoid literal word-by-word translation.
- English should be plain, modern, and empathetic; avoid jargon.
- Keep placeholders such as {{count}} or {{email}} unchanged.
- Keep domain terms stable:
  - trait exploration -> 特质探索
  - non-clinical / not a clinical diagnosis -> 非临床 / 非临床诊断
  - safety pause -> 安全暂停
  - coaching session -> 教练会话
